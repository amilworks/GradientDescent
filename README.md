# Linear Regression using Gradient Descent

For all of you PSTAT 126 students out there, and, well, people who have taken a course on _Linear Regression_, here is an example of how to start expanding your theoretical knowledge horizon. This example requires you know some basic `Python`. If you don't know the basics, seriously ask yourself why you are here, why you still exist, and why you think you will learn from someone who sucks at `Java`. 

We will begin by defining an error function that measures how “good” a given line is. Remember, we are trying to fit a line of _best_ fit. Computing this function will return an error value based on how well the line fits our data.

Next, these two equations will give us a helping hand when attempting to find the minimum.
